# Token

I created a token as Sky Line with Solidity. This piece of program can keep track of total supply of token, mint and burn token. 

## Description

Here Token as Sky Line  also known as SL is created by using solidity for Ethereum blockchain. And this program is capable of minting and burning of token. it can give us total supply of token.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste MyToken.sol into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Now at the left bottom side of the page there is section called as Deployed Contracts. below that as you can see contract is deployed and by clicking into MYTOKEN there are functions like burnCoin, mintCoin which will burn and mint coin respectively after that balances button will give balance of the address that you put into the text field right side of the button. further there are 3 more button which will give token name, its abbrevation and total supply.
